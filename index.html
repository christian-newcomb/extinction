                      <p>
                        This extinct subspecies of brown bear was once Africa's only native bear. Recognized by the distinct reddish orange fur that covered its underparts, the animal was hunted to extinction almost entirely for the purpose of sport. In fact, they were often captured and used for the execution of criminals ad bestias after the Roman Empire expanded into North Africa.
                        The last specimens ever recorded being seen were killed by hunters in the 1870s.</p>
                        <p>Following the expansion of the Roman Empire in Northern Africa, thousands of bears were hunted for sport, used for execution of criminals, and killed during venatio games. The Atlas Bear is believed to have become extinct in the 1870s.

          <h3>Range and Description</h3>
                <p>Named after the Atlas Mountains that spans modern-day Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, the Atlas Bear (Ursus Arctos crowtherii) was the only bear ever to be native to Africa. Most naturalists consider this shaggy giant to be a subspecies of the Brown Bear (Ursus arctos), while others argue that it deserves its own species name under the Ursus genus.
                  it was hunted intensively for sport, and captured for arena combat, by the Romans that conquered northern Africa in the first century A.D. Scattered populations of the Atlas Bear persisted until the late 19th century, when the last remnants were wiped out in Morocco's Rif Mountains.</p>

                  <p>Where the Atlas bear actually originated from is unknown, one genetic study was unable to link it to any brown bear, but it had weak but significant mtDNA links to the polar bear. Polar bears appear in Paleolithic cave paintings in Andalucia Spain, which is a very short swim to the Atlas Mountains for a polar bear.</p>
